# FIC-PHP
A PHP Group Project that was done during my Foundation years. My team created a MySQL database website on the purpose of creating a Library System for Admin uses. As PHP is a hard language to learn for beginners, and as all of us in the team only had about 3 weeks to understand PHP, our final product was unfortunately very mediocre and unsatisfactory.
