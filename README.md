# FIC-PHP
A PHP Group Project that was done during my Foundation years. My team created MySQL on the purpose of creating a Library System for Admin uses. As PHP was quite hard to learn for beginners, as all of us in the team only had about 3 weeks to understand PHP, our final product was unfortunately very mediocre and unsatisfactory.
